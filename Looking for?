I am a recent graduate and an enthusiastic learner, currently exploring different fields to find my area of interest. During my college years, I completed two projects, which helped me gain practical experience, even though I don't have a particular favorite yet.

I'm actively seeking job opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and learn. While I may not have a specific specialization yet, I am open-minded, adaptable, and eager to take on new challenges in any suitable role.

Looking for: Full-time job opportunities
Open to: Connecting with professionals and learning new things
